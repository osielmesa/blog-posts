This is the 2nd post ([previous post here](https://osiel.hashnode.dev/12-react-and-react-native-questions-and-answers-1st-post)) from a series where I will cover 12 react and react native common questions and answers every week until we reach 60 of them. After reaching that goal I will continue growing this list but from time to time. Useful links can be found in the answers. Corrections and suggestions are more than welcome.

1. **What are the advantages of using React Native?**
    
    React Native offers [several advantages](https://reactnative.dev/):
    
    * Create platform-specific versions of components so a single codebase can share code across platforms. With React Native, one team can maintain multiple platforms and share a common technology.
        
    * It allows code reusability taking advantage of React key features, enabling developers to share a significant portion of code between platforms.
        
    * React Native provides faster development cycles with hot reloading, allowing an immediate preview of changes.
        
    * React Native lets you create truly native apps and doesn't compromise your users' experiences. It provides a core set of platform-agnostic native components.
        
2. **What is the purpose of the render() method in React?**
    
    The render() method is a lifecycle method in React that is responsible for rendering the UI components onto the screen. It is called whenever the component needs to be updated due to changes in state or props.
    
3. **What is the significance of keys in React lists?**
    
    [Keys are used in React lists to help identify each list item uniquely.](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html) They assist React in efficiently updating the list by detecting additions, removals, and reordering of list items. You can check [rendering list](https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists) for more details.
    
4. **What is the role of shouldComponentUpdate() method?**
    
    The [shouldComponentUpdate() method](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#shouldcomponentupdate-in-action) is a lifecycle method that allows developers to control whether a component should re-render or not. By implementing this method, developers can optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-rendering of components.
    
5. **What is the purpose of refs in React?**
    
    [Refs](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#gatsby-focus-wrapper) are used to get a reference to a specific React element or component. They provide a way to access and manipulate the underlying DOM node directly. Refs are useful for cases where direct [DOM manipulation](https://react.dev/learn/manipulating-the-dom-with-refs) or measurement is required.
    
6. **How can you pass data between components in React?**
    
    Data can be passed between components in React [using props](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#step-1-pass-props-to-the-child-component) or by using a state management library like [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html) or [Context API](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) included in React. Props allow parent components to pass data down to their child components, enabling component composition and reusability.
    
7. **How can you handle navigation in React Native?**
    
    Navigation in React Native can be handled using libraries like [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) or [React Native Navigation](https://wix.github.io/react-native-navigation/docs/before-you-start/). These libraries provide a set of navigational components and APIs to create navigational flows and handle routing in mobile applications.
    
8. **How can you debug React Native applications?**
    
    React Native provides various tools for debugging applications. [React Native Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger) is a standalone debugger with a rich set of debugging features. [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) can also be used for debugging React Native applications by enabling remote debugging. Additionally, the React Native CLI provides useful commands for inspecting and debugging the app. React Native provides an [in-app developer menu](https://reactnative.dev/docs/debugging) which offers several debugging options.
    
9. **What is the purpose of FlatList in React Native?**
    
    [FlatList](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist) is a performant component in React Native used for rendering large lists of data efficiently. It only renders the visible items on the screen, recycling the off-screen items to optimize memory usage and rendering performance. There is a great post in React native docs about [optimizing FlatList configuration](https://reactnative.dev/docs/optimizing-flatlist-configuration) to boost the performance of FlatList according to our needs following the pros and cons of every property provided.
    
10. **How can you optimize the performance of a React application?**
    
    Performance optimization in React can be achieved by following best practices such as using the virtual DOM efficiently, minimizing unnecessary re-renders, using [shouldComponentUpdate](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#shouldcomponentupdate) or [React.memo](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo) to prevent re-rendering, [lazy loading](https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy) components or data, code splitting, and optimizing network requests. Additionally, tools like [React DevTools](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools) and performance profiling can help identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.
    
11. **What is the purpose of error boundaries in React?**
    
    [Error boundaries are React components](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#catching-rendering-errors-with-an-error-boundary) that catch and handle JavaScript errors that occur during rendering, in lifecycle methods, or in the entire component tree below them. They allow you to gracefully handle errors and prevent the entire application from crashing.
    
12. **How can you handle authentication and authorization in React applications?**
    
    Authentication and authorization in React applications can be handled by implementing authentication workflows and mechanisms to ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can access certain parts of the application, protecting routes or components based on user roles or permissions. Libraries like [OAuth](https://auth0.com/) or [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth) can be used for implementing authentication mechanisms.
    
    It's important to follow security best practices when implementing authentication and authorization in React applications. These include properly storing (if needed) and securing user credentials, implementing measures to prevent common vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and using secure communication protocols like [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS).
